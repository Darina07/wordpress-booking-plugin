This is a WordPress Booking (Calendar) Custom Plugin

Task Description:
    Set up a clean Wordpress theme.
    Create a calendar for booking date and time, adhering to the design shown in the image.
    Upon clicking a date on the calendar, open a list with the title "Select Time", displaying hours from 9:00 to 17:30 in 30-minute intervals.
    Upon clicking the "Continue" button, hide the calendar and time slots, and display "Information" with the date and time the client selected for booking.
    Below the information for the date and time, include 3 fields for Name, Email Address, Phone Number, and two checkboxes for agreeing to policies (with all fields except the opt-in for offers notification being mandatory).
    Upon clicking the "Save Consultation Time" button, send all information (date, time, name, email address, phone number) to the admin's email.
    After sending the email and returning to the calendar, clicking on the date and time should render them inactive and grayed out (indicating a newly registered time slot).
    All past dates should be inactive.
    In the admin panel, there should be a calendar displaying scheduled hours from 9:00 to 17:30, possibly on a "Home" page, and it should be linked to the interface calendar.
    From the admin section, clicking on a date should bring up a field for entering text (as shown in the image). Clicking OK/Update should save the entry in the field (as shown in the image), and that particular time slot should become inactive (grayed out) on the user interface for that specific date.
    There should be an option for deleting a time slot from a specific date on the admin calendar.
    All booked hours on a specific date from both the user calendar and the admin calendar should be absolutely identical.
